Inspired by Toke Høye’s PollinatorWatch (hosted by [Zooniverse](www.zooniverse.org)), we are setting up time-lapse cameras to gather hundreds or maybe thousands of images of pollinators visiting two common native flowering plants, salal and dull Oregon grape, at a mid-island location on Galiano Island, in the Pacific Northwest. We plan to automate the analysis of the images to document the number and type of pollinator visitors we get over the flowering season. We have also set up a weather station and particulate matter sensor to gather hyperlocal weather and air quality data in the immediate vicinity of our cameras. In additon to monitoring trends in air quality, the particulate matter sensor should give us an estimate of pollen count and detect smoke in the air from wildfire drift. In addition to piloting the technology, the images will be a window to the day-to-day ins and outs of Galiano pollinators that will help us better understand how wildflowers and pollinators are affected by local weather events.  



# Background
***

 Wild pollinators are an integral part of native plant communities, and are highly effective at pollinating flowers in natural ecosystems. Plant pollination is essential for plant reproduction, which in turn provides fruits and seeds for wildlife. Abundance and diversity of pollinators ensure a stable, highly productive ecosystem.
 

 Managed pollinator services, AKA honey bees, are essential for or enhance the pollination and therefore production of many agricultural crops that we eat. Alongside honey bees, wild pollinators such as bumble bees, other types of bees, wasps, and other non-bee species, also make an important contribution to crop production. 
 

 Changing environmental conditions caused by weather, climate change, or human interventions, can disrupt pollinator activity for some species but enhance it for others. The biodiversity and abundance of wild bee populations and other non-bee pollinators provides redundancy within natural ecosystems that ensures ongoing pollination and plant productivity despite a changing environment. 
 

 As we rely heavily on honey bees for certain types of food production - for example honey bees are considered essential to sustaining the global supply of almonds - it is worrying that they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to environmental stressors and are well recognized globally to be under threat.  Interestingly though, on organic farms near natural habitat, wild bees can provide full pollinator services, but with diversity being key to sustained success (Kremen, 2002). It seems though that if we make adjustments that favour abundance and diversity of wild pollinators it's possible to build capacity and resilience within natural and farmed ecosystems that offsets a shortfall in managed pollinator services caused by environmental changes.
 
 

## Bumble bee species in flux in British Columbia

 Decline of bumble bees has been reported in North America and Europe and is of global concern (Soroye, 2020). Although there are over 500 known bee species in BC, there is not a lot of historical information about pollinator populations to use as a baseline. However, we do know that at least one bee species, the western bumble bee, the western bumble, *Bombus occidentalis*, has significantly declined (Wray, accessed Mar 21, 2021). The authors discuss how it used to be very common in the lower mainland in the 1980s, representing 25-30% of bumble bee species collected on local berry farms, but by 2003/2004 had dwindled to less than 1% of the bees collected. Since then, this bee species was sighted just a handful of times on Vancouver Island in 2012, and once in the lower mainland at Boundary Bay in 2013 - according to a local newspaper report, it was last spotted on Galiano in 1990. In contrast, it seems the yellow-faced bumble bee, *B. vosnesenskii*, may be gaining ground in the region (Fraser, 2012).
