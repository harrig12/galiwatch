# Study Site
***

Galiano is a long narrow island of the Southern Gulf Island chain situated on the western edge of the Salish Sea. Located within the coastal Douglas-fir `r pop_gloss("Biogeoclimatic zone")`, it has a semi-arid ecosystem characterized by a mild climate with cool wet winters and warm dry summers, with annual drought conditions typically from mid-June to early October. Image adapted from [Galiano Story](galianostory.com/FLORAFAUNA.htm). 


 Native tree species include coast Douglas-fir, western red cedar, arbutus, western hemlock, grand fir, Garry oak, red alder, and big leaf maple. Native plants commonly found in the understorey include salal, Oregon grape, sword fern, vanilla leaf, and a variety of grasses, wildflowers, mosses, and lichens. This rural island  remains relatively intact ecologically.

  The study site is situated mid island surrounded by the Mid Galiano Protected Areas Network, and within the Greig creek watershed. Cameras will be positioned to survey insect visitations to a salal patch and a dull Oregon grape patch in proximity to a seasonally occupied log cabin. Weather data (temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, air quality, and particulate matter data will be collected at the location using Raspberry pi Enviro sensors, as well as by an independent weather station positioned close by. There are a wide variety of native and introduced flowering plants in the immediate vicinity.

 Proximate habitat within about a 1/2 km radius includes bare bedrock, light well-draining sandy soil interspersed with clay deposits, and soil with high organic content from fallen trees and branches. Urbanisation includes several other nearby properties, some seasonal, others occupied year-round, which are serviced by paved roads, as well as about an acre of productive farmland (flowering crops include sunflowers, peas, beans, potatoes, basil, and artichokes, etc). There are two man-made ponds as well as areas of wetland and rough pasture.

# Weather Monitoring
***

 Researchers have discovered that honey bees are able to detect changes in weather and alter their behaviour accordingly. Honey bees for example can be seen to respond minute-to-minute to the local weather conditions outside their hive, with the temperature and amount of sunlight being the most important factors signalling them to fly (Clark, 2018). In other studies, honey bees were seen to increase their foraging activity the day before a rainy day, but continued on a steady course when the weather was set fair (He, 2016). And, it also seems that different species of bees have adapted different levels of resilience to weather conditions and will forage at different temperatures and light intensities, with some species continuing to forage even in strong winds or light rain (Vicens, Like honey bees, bumble bees feed on nectar and pollen and bring these resources back to the nest to feed their young. Perhaps not surprisingly, local weather conditions are found to influence their foraging activity too, but in this case it seems to be the humidity that is most important - the more humid it gets the more foraging there is, and bumble bees will forage whatever the temperature, wind speed, or cloud cover (Peat, 2005). These authors also found that the weather influenced whether bumble bees collected nectar or pollen, with more pollen being collected when the humidity was low and it was warm and windy, than on damper days. Their guess is that these conditions  likely make pollen easier for the bees to handle.

 
 
##	Equipment
*	Raspberry Pi Enviro + Air Quality
*	Accurite Atlas weather station 


 We will be investigating the connection between hyperlocal weather conditions and pollinator activity at our test site. The weather sensors and weather station are equipped to measure temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, total rainfall, pressure, UV, and light intensity. Readings are dumped every 30s to an SD card. 


## Air quality monitoring

 The air quality monitoring sensors will give us an idea of how air quality changes over time. They measure changes in concentrations of reducing (e.g., carbon monoxide) and oxidising gases (e.g., nitrogen dioxide), and ammonia. The sensors measure electrical resistance according to the concentration of gases in the air. The reducing gases and ammonia resistance readings will drop with increasing concentrations of these gases, while resistance readings produced by the presence of oxidising gases will increase.
 
 The particulate matter sensor detects concentrations of particles of different sizes (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) as well as the number of particles of different sizes (>0.3, >0.5, >1.0, >2.5, >5, and >10 microns). Wildfire smoke particles typically range from 0.4–0.7 microns, dust is around 2.5 microns, while pollen is generally 15 microns or more.

# Pollinator detection  
***

It’s well known that bees are important wildflower pollinators; however, many non-bee pollinators including wasps, hover flies, other flies, beetles, butterflies, moths, and hummingbirds also visit flowering plants and are often overlooked in pollinator monitoring studies. Although these non-bee visitors deposit a lot less pollen per visit, they can make up for it by visiting much more frequently (Rader, 2016). Local surveys of bee species that pollinate salal and dull Oregon grape report bumble bees to be the primary pollinators, with other bee species visiting less frequently (Wray & Elle, [SFU Pollination Ecology Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/people/eelle/bee_info.html)). 



##	Equipment
+	`r pop_gloss('Raspberry Pi')` for computing power
+	Raspberry Pi's high quality cameras for time-lapse photography 
+	`r pop_gloss('YOLO')` on Raspberry Pi and `r pop_gloss('Movidius NCS2')` for `r pop_gloss('Deep learning')` insect detection and image screening  


 We have mounted two surveillance cameras comprising of a Raspberry Pi (powered off the mains) fitted with a Pi camera and an `r pop_gloss('SD card')`, inside a waterproof box. The cameras have been situated so that they point down towards the patches of salal and dull Oregon grape. By positioning the cameras about a meter from the tops of the plants, we can film an area of about half a square meter with high resolution. The cameras are set to take a picture every 30s and the images are stored on the SD card.


# Data Analysis
***

 Our cameras should capture approximately 0.5 million images (2 terrabytes of data!) over the six-month study period. We hope there will be hundreds or even thousands of images of visiting pollinators. As it would take an overwhelming amount of time to manually look for images containing insects, we are recruiting computers to do it for us, which requires training and running a neural network. We are currently testing YOLO with a Movidius Neural Compute Stick for this task.


## Bee species, non-bee species and other pollinators of Galiano Island


 Although our two test plants salal and dull Oregon grape are particularly attractive to bumble bees, many other species of pollinators have been sighted on Galiano and we are interested to see if any of these are captured in our images. Our reference resource for insect identification is the [Biodiversity Galiano](https://biogaliano.org/) project, a community-based initiative to document the flora and fauna of Galiano Island, initiated in January 2016. So far, over 2,500 species have been reported of which more than 1,000 are `r pop_gloss('Arthropods')`. Among these are 82 species of bees and wasps including honey bees (*Apis mellifera*), bumblebees (*Bombus* spp.) mining bees (*Andrena* spp.), long-horned bees (*Eucera* spp.), mason bees (*Osmia* spp.), cuckoo bees (*Nomada* spp.), sweat bees (*Halictus* and *Lasioglossum* spp.), blood bees (*Sphecodes* spp.), and various wasps.  


  We will use this database to help ID any pollinators we see in our time-lapse images.

  mutate(Species = stringr::str_to_title(Species)) %>%
  datatable(filter = 'top', options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE))
```




 With systems up and running we hope to collect data from late March to early September including: 

*	Images of `r pop_gloss('Salal')` and `r pop_gloss('Dull Oregon grape')` from bud burst to fruit maturation.  
*	Images of pollinators showing when and how often they come to visit, and enabling identification of different species.
*	Day-to-day weather data, including high and low temperatures, pressure, humidity (Raspberry pi and Accurite), wind speed and direction, total rainfall, UV and light intensity (Accurite only). This will enable comparison of the two systems, and establish reproducibility of the instruments.
*	Climate data including average, maximum and minimum temperatures; light intensity; pressure; wind speed, and total rainfall accumulation.
*	Estimates of reducing and oxidising gases, and ammonia representing trends of increasing or decreasing air quality, and estimates of particulates, such as dust, pollen, mould spores, smoke etc.  



In addition to piloting the technology, the images and weather data will provide baseline information about our test site including:

1.	Date of bud burst and duration of flowering of salal and dull Oregon grape.
2.	Pollinator community composition visiting these plants during the flowering season (bees, hoverflies, butterflies, moths, wasps, other flies, beetles, hummingbirds). 
3.	Time of first appearance and seasonal dynamics of different pollinators. 
4.	How much of a role, if any, non-bee visitors play in the pollination of these two native plants. 
5.	How hyperlocal weather and variations in air quality influence pollinator activity. 

The images and weather data will add to what is already known about pollinators in coastal Douglas-fir ecosystems on the west coast of British Columbia and provide additional information about pollinator behaviour both throughout the day and day-to-day while plants are in bloom.
